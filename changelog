Seventh Commit (17/07/2020)
Adjusted the navbar to accomodate the dropdown (resulted in a bit expanded navigation icon tray)
(Tried to) adjust navbar width.. from col-lg-8 offset-lg-2 to col-lg-10 offset-lg-1 to better accomodate on Windows machine and some other hit and trial CSS changes(may need rework)
Made the required pending dropdowns in all pages (messages settings in /messages, report dropdown on posts)
Info in active chat window now toggles between Chat window and Chat info(with only the basics for now)
