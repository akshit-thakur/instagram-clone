*******************
TODO:
Comment box and About Box are at odds
Profile modals not working as intended
profile story viewStory is passing props but not displaying as desired(Windows)
Make modal for story highlights
ChooseNav defaults to posts on refresh(Windows)
Responsiveness
Not all profiles showing
Clicking reply doesn't focus the comment box
See if modals can show without displacing components behind
Reduce unneccessary props passed around
Take care of commented code
Make the code consistent with the video
Mostly CSS arrangements which is a continuous process anyways
